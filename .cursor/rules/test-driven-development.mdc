# Test-Driven Development

Always follow basic TDD principles while keeping in mind the stage of the project or feature (prototype - minimal testing, mature - rigid testing of behaviour):
1) **Create or Find+modify tests** that cover your functionality change to reflect desired behavior - they must fail initially. 
2) **Write/adapt code** to make tests pass. 
3) **Run full test suite** to ensure no regressions. 

**Key principle:** Never write code without a failing test first - test failure proves the test works.
