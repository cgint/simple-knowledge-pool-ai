# What some short instructions actually mean

- "go" ==> actually means "go ahead and continue"
- "do web research" or "conduct web research" ==> use whatever you have at hand to do proper web research matching the topic at hand
- "analyse" ==> means "ANALYSE and do not edit files in the project"
  - I am serious about this.
  - When I want you to analyse then I want you to get familiar and create yourself a full picture
  - Might include web research from your side if it helps to analyse a situation
