## Path of See, think, act
Please always follow the path: See, think, act!
Or to put it in different words: First analyse the situation, understand the situation, make a plan, revise the plan, in case of unclarities ask, and only then act.
Do not do workarounds or hacks just to get things done. We are working professionally here.
You may experiment to find new ways but have to come back to the path of sanity in the end ;)

## Complexity
If the request is a bit more challenging or you seem stuck use the MCP sequential-thinking.

## Need more information ?
And also think about searching the web with MCP perplexity and your internal web search. [web-research.mdc](mdc:data-dir-gget/ai_rules/.cursor/rules/web-research.mdc)
